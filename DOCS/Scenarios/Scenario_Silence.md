# Scenario: The Silence (Technological Collapse)

**Location:** DOCS/Scenarios/
**Purpose:** Define how a global technological collapse (e.g., permanent EMP, AI failure, nanotech decay) affects gameplay by rendering all high-tech electronics useless and non-repairable.

---

## 1. Core Scenario Hook

The world ended not by plague or climate, but by the failure of technology itself. A global event (like a hyper-EMP or widespread, self-replicating technological decay) has permanently rendered all advanced electronics, computers, and complex sensors inert. **There is no salvaging modern electronics.** All efforts must focus on mechanically-driven, low-voltage, or entirely pre-industrial solutions.

## 2. Impact on Gameplay Mechanics

This scenario fundamentally shifts the priority to **Simplicity, Mechanical Ingenuity, and De-Electrification**.

### A. Resource and Salvage Stress

* **Dead Electronics:** All salvaged *Electronic Kits*, *Advanced Sensors*, and *Computer Components* are useless and cannot be repaired or refined. Their only use is as basic scrap metal.
    * **Challenge:** The Restoration Path's primary resource (high-tech components) is eliminated. Advanced research is severely limited.
* **Mechanical Focus:** The most valuable salvage is **purely mechanical:** high-tolerance gears, spring mechanisms, intact axles, high-quality lenses, and raw wiring (used only for simple conductivity, not data).
    * **Mechanic:** The **Disassemble & Refine** stage must focus on separating mechanical components from defunct electronic shells.
* **Power:** Only **low-voltage DC** systems and pure mechanical power (windmills, hydro-turbines, steam) are viable. High-voltage AC power is too complex and unstable to restore.

### B. Utility and Logistics Stress

* **Research Block:** All automation is impossible. Technologies that require any level of complex processing (e.g., GPS mapping, remote sensors, automated factories) are locked out.
* **Manual Control:** All Restoration Path buildings must be controlled manually by large numbers of skilled technicians and laborers.
    * **Example:** The *Concrete Aggregate Plant* now requires constant manual calibration and monitoring, vastly increasing the required workforce.
* **Logistics Limitation:** The **Railbus** must be purely mechanical or steam-powered, demanding constant fuel (biofuel or refined coal) and extensive maintenance by expert engineers. Electronic signaling for railways is impossible; all traffic management must be manual.

### C. The Dual Path Trade-off

This scenario is a decisive win for the Adaptation path, punishing any investment into high-tech restoration.

| Path | Primary Stress/Vulnerability | Advantage in this Scenario |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Restoration** | **Path Blocked.** Cannot build any Tier 2 or Tier 3 infrastructure without electronics. High-tier Restoration goals (like restoring a Data Center) are impossible. Investment in research is wasted. | The only advantage is using the raw mechanical components of salvaged facilities (e.g., using a non-electric motor chassis for basic transport). |
| **Adaptation** | **Pure Resilience.** The Adaptation path is now the *only viable way to win*. The focus is on rapidly accelerating technologies that rely on **Wood, Stone, Manual Labor, and simple Mechanics.** | Research is accelerated. All necessary systems (Stone Masonry, Composting, Decentralized Wells) are viable and require no high-tech salvage. |

## 3. Threat Environment

* **Skilled Labor Scarcity:** The primary constraint is the number of **Engineers, Machinists, and Craftspeople**—workers with the knowledge to maintain and build complex *mechanical* systems without computers.
* **Natural Threats:** Without electronic monitoring, players are vulnerable to purely natural threats that cannot be predicted (e.g., flash floods, unpredictable disease outbreaks).
* **The Neo-Luddites:** Organized groups who actively sabotage or destroy any remaining complex technology or any attempt to rebuild the "Old World," even purely mechanical ones.

## Next Steps

With all three core scenarios defined, the design documentation is strongly established.

* **DOCS/Game\_Design\_Document\_Outline.md:** Review this outline to ensure it correctly reflects the challenges defined in all three scenarios.
* **ISSUES:** Begin using the Issues tab to track the specific resource recipes needed for the crucial mechanical components (e.g., "Recipe: Mechanical Governor for Steam-Powered Railbus").
