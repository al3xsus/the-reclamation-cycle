# Scenario: The Desertion (Climate/Drought Collapse)

**Purpose:** Define how a catastrophic climate event (Drought, Extreme Heat, Desertification) alters core gameplay challenges, resource availability, and primary threats.

## 1. Core Scenario Hook

The world ended due to radical climate change: persistent mega-droughts, searing heatwaves, and aggressive desertification have rendered vast regions uninhabitable. The air is often filled with abrasive dust, and the primary resource challenge is the acquisition and retention of **water**.

## 2. Impact on Gameplay Mechanics

This scenario fundamentally shifts the priority to **Water Scarcity, Insulation, and Terraforming**.

### A. Resource and Salvage Stress

* **Water is Gold:** Surface water is nearly non-existent or highly mineralized. Deep aquifer drilling is necessary but requires specialized equipment.
    * **Challenge:** Water consumption rates for both people and utilities are significantly increased due to the heat. All food production requires constant, efficient **irrigation**.
    * **Mechanic:** Failure to provide enough water leads rapidly to population health decline and heatstroke events, especially during summer cycles.
* **Sand and Abrasion:** Dust is the constant enemy. Salvaged mechanical components suffer from premature wear and tear.
    * **Challenge:** The lifespan of **Motors, Engines, and Gears** is significantly reduced. Maintenance frequency and replacement costs for these items increase significantly.
    * **Advantage:** Glass and reflective materials (useful for solar power and insulation) are highly valued salvage items.

### B. Utility and Logistics Stress

* **Insulation and Cooling:** Buildings must be shielded from the sun. Uninsulated housing or storage leads to resource spoilage (food, chemicals) and worker fatigue.
    * **Adaptation Advantage:** **Stone Masonry** and thick-walled structures provide natural insulation, requiring fewer cooling systems.
    * **Restoration Challenge:** Metallic, thin-walled **Pre-Fab Housing** requires significant power investment for active cooling systems (fans, air conditioning).
* **Transport Hazard:** Open transport routes are subject to sudden, blinding **Dust Storms**.
    * **Challenge:** Transport links (especially rail) can become temporarily disabled or buried, requiring specialized salvage crews to clear the route before traffic can resume.

### C. The Dual Path Trade-off

The Desertion scenario tests the sustainability and resilience of the chosen infrastructure against brutal environmental conditions.

| Path | Primary Stress/Vulnerability | Advantage in this Scenario |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Restoration** | **Power Consumption.** Maintaining climate control in high-density, metallic structures requires massive, centralized power generation (which consumes fuel or precious deep water for cooling). | Large-scale, high-tech **Desalination/Filtration Plants** offer the only path to high-volume water production necessary for a megapolis. |
| **Adaptation** | **Crop Yield.** Low-tech irrigation methods (like simple ditch watering) are highly inefficient, leading to very low food yields and forcing a reliance on tough, drought-resistant crops. | **Low Maintenance.** The systems are simple, resisting damage from sand abrasion, and requiring less water-intensive cooling. |

## 3. Threat Environment

* **Extreme Weather:** The environment itself is the main threat (Dust Storms, Heatwaves).
* **Feral Beasts:** Wildlife adapted to the drought (e.g., highly aggressive scavengers) are driven closer to settlements in search of water. They pose a persistent, localized threat to outlying wells and farms.
* **Raiders:** Organized groups of survivors motivated purely by the theft of **Water and Fuel** pose a consistent defense challenge.

## Next Steps

* **DOCS/Scenarios/Scenario\_Silence.md:** Outline the Technological Collapse scenario, where the primary challenge shifts from external threats to the **internal struggle** of rebuilding low-tech civilization when all advanced electronics are permanently dead.
* **ISSUES:** Create issues detailing the specific resource/power costs for Insulation and Cooling systems across the two tech paths.
