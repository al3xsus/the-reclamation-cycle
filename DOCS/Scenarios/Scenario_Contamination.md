# Scenario: The Contamination (Fungal/Viral Collapse)

**Purpose:** Define how the Fungal/Viral/Infection collapse scenario alters the core gameplay challenges, resource availability, and primary threats.

## 1. Core Scenario Hook

The world ended not with fire, but with a rapid, airborne fungal infection that turned most of humanity into aggressive, nomadic carriers ("The Infected"). The environment is saturated with spores and biological hazards.

## 2. Impact on Gameplay Mechanics

This scenario fundamentally shifts the priority to **Isolation, Sanitation, and Defense**.

### A. Resource and Salvage Stress

* **Tainted Salvage:** A high percentage of Old World Salvage (especially textiles, wood, and organic materials) is tainted with spores or biological residue.
    * **Challenge:** Tainted materials must be filtered, incinerated, or treated *before* refinement, consuming extra resources (chemicals, fuel) and time.
    * **Mechanic:** Failure to treat Tainted Salvage can lead to localized **Outbreaks** in the settlement.
* **Contaminated Water:** All surface water sources are highly suspect.
    * **Challenge:** Clean water requires sophisticated **filtration** (Restoration Path) or deep, sealed **wells/cisterns** (Adaptation Path). Simple cisterns risk contamination.
* **Scarcity:** Chemical agents, medical supplies, and filtration components are extremely rare and prioritized over all other salvage.

### B. Utility and Logistics Stress

* **Sanitation is Paramount:** Sewage and waste management is critical. Poor sanitation leads directly to disease and population stability loss.
    * **Adaptation Advantage:** The **Biological Composting System** is highly effective here, turning a threat (waste) into a non-hazardous resource (fertilizer).
    * **Restoration Challenge:** Centralized **Water Treatment Plants** are highly effective, but failure or damage can lead to massive, centralized contamination events.
* **Transport Risk:** Infected groups are attracted to noise, forcing players to manage the noise profile of their transport (railbus/trucks) or face random ambushes during transit.

### C. The Dual Path Trade-off

The contamination scenario creates unique pressure points for both paths:

| Path | Primary Stress/Vulnerability | Advantage in this Scenario |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Restoration** | **High Maintenance Failure.** Delicate electronic and pipe systems are highly susceptible to biological ingress (fungal growth, corrosion from tainted water). Maintenance costs skyrocket. | High-volume water filtration and centralized medical research are highly effective at curing large outbreaks. |
| **Adaptation** | **Low-Density Defense.** Low population density makes wide-area defense difficult. Low-tech structures are more vulnerable to brute force attacks from the Infected. | Resilient to maintenance failure (fewer complex parts to contaminate). Localized systems prevent cascading failures. |

## 3. Threat Environment

* **The Infected:** The primary external threat. They are attracted to noise, light, and high concentrations of people. Combat is necessary to secure new salvage zones.
* **Outbreaks:** Internal threat triggered by contaminated resources or poor sanitation. Must be contained immediately via medical intervention or quarantine (at the cost of labor/resources).

## Next Steps

* **DOCS/Scenarios/Scenario\_Desertion.md:** Outline the Climate/Drought catastrophe scenario, where the primary challenge shifts from biological contamination to **Water Scarcity** and **Extreme Weather**.
* **ISSUES:** Create issues detailing specific resource costs for sanitation buildings (e.g., how much chemical agent is needed to run the Restoration Water Filtration Plant for a week).
